    "en": "As an EOS block producer candidate and all of the team members are EOS long term holders, we want to try our best to protect EOS holders benefits. Here are some thoughts. Try to be different than other block producer candidates; Try to include more traditional business into EOS ecology; Try to build an arbitration forum, and help to train more people about EOS constitution, contracts and arbitration process; Partner with lawyers, institutions and incubators worldwide to help EOS ecology thrive; Try to maximize the EOS token value by assigning new meanings to EOS tokens instead of creating new tokens; for instance, we will try to develop Dapps without creating new tokens. ",
