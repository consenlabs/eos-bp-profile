    "en": "The HelloEOS team was originated from the HelloBTS community established in 2014. BTS (BitShares) is the first blockchain project promoted by EOS founder Daniel Larimer (BM). HelloEOS is composed of the most powerful Graphene development forces and some of the senior community participants in China. The team has implemented in-depth research in Graphene blockchain technology, DPOS consensus algorithm and DAC distributed autonomous concept and the outcomes of the research have been put into practice. With the comprehensive capabilities in graphene blockchain network development and maintenance, HelloEOS is one of the prioneering groups to research and advocate the idea of EOS in China. Its founder Zi Cen is still a member of the BitShares committee. In March 2018, HelloEOS officially announced its participation in the EOS super node campaign. Based on its community strength and technological R&D capacities, the team is actively involved in the development of the EOS ecosystem. In May 2018, HelloEOS reached a cooperation agreement with Shui Mu Feng Hua, the BIC Capital and the Fuyun Capital, which represents the start of HelloEOS’ corporatization process to stimulate standardization and professionalization which are considered the quality of a Block Producer candidate. In the meantime, HelloEOS sets up a specific incubation fund with the amount of CNY 1 billion in the initial phase – HelloBIC, and has completed its series PreA financing round with the amount of CNY 150 million in early June. So far, HelloEOS has formed a vigorous team for the EOS ecosystem development, covering the priority areas of community, technology, industrial park, research institution and incubation fund. At present, HelloEOS is devoting itself to building a top EOS node and community. With the support of its own advantages and strengths, HelloEOS will facilitate the development of the EOS ecosystem following the six main lines of action, coming as node maintenance, network security, technology research and development, capacity-building for developers, professional media and HelloEOS clubs.",
